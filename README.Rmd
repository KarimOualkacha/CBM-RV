## CBM-RV

This is an R package which implements a Multivariate Copula-Based Rare-Varaints (CBM-RV) region-based association test, in presence of familial data. 

CBM-RV is a statistical tool for testing the association between a mutivariate response vector and a genomic region. It is a copula-based method that allows for flexible modelling of the dependence between two test statitics and provides a unified p.value. It implements four test statistics:

- ```optimal.p``` (default);
- ```minimum.p```, minimum p-value;
- ```Qscore```, p-value based on the Q score statistic;
- ```QFisher```, p-value based on the Fisher combination of p-values derived from Q1 and Q2.

CBM-RV allows for dependence modelling using four copulas

- ```Gaussian``` (default);
- ```Student```, Student copula with degree of freedom equals 10;
- ```Clayton```, Clayton copula; 
- ```Frank```, Frank copula.

For this first version, we provide score test ans p.value calculation in the bivariate case.

For more information you can look at the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pcev/vignettes/pcev.pdf). Alternatively, if you have already installed the package along with the vignette, you can access the vignette from within ```R``` by using the following command:

If you have already installed the package, you can take a look on a running example for more information. you can access the main vignette from within R by using the following command:

``` r
vignette("pcev")
```

## Installation

This package is available on the ... [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pcev). It can be installed from GitHub using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) package:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('GreenwoodLab/CBM-RV', build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The main functions are ```CMB-RV``` and ```CMB-RV.null```, and indeed most users will only need these two functions. See the functions documentation for more information about their parameters and for some examples.

## Running example
Before running an association test with one (or more) of the methods,
the following data needs to be present:

"Phenotype data"; phenotype data should be present in the form of
an R matrix (one raw for each individual). It is up to you (as user)
to create the matrix, for example by reading it from a CSV file using R's
|read.csv()| function or like this:

data(phenotypes)
head(phenotypes)

@
Covariate data; this data should be present in the form
  of a matrix. Like the phenotype data it is up to you to load this
  data. Here we will load the data from the CBM-RV package:

``` r
data(covariates)
dim(covariates)
```

Genotype data; genotype data this data should be present in the form
  of a matrix.
``` r
data(genotypes)
head(genotypes)
dim(covariates)
```

Relationship matrix; each of the methods requires a (symmetric) relationship matrix (2 $\times$ the kinship matrix). In this example we will load this matrix from the CBM-RV package.

``` r
load("kin1.Rdata")
kin <- 2 *kin1
dim(kin)
```
To run the main function and get p.value estimates, one needs to estimate the phenotypes variances-covariances matrix under the null model.

``` r
null.obj = CBM.RV.Null(Y, 
                       covariates = covariates, 
                       kin, 
                       nb.running.guess = 3)
``` 
Now one can run the main function in order to calculate copula-based p.value:

``` r
CBM.RV(y=Y, 
       G=Geno, 
       covariates=covariates, 
       null.obj=null.obj, 
       copfit="Gaussian", 
       method="optimal.p")
```
